/**
 * One of the builtin TypeScript types is "object".
 *
 * Objects are used extensively in JavaScript applications, so you may
 * be tempted to use the "object" type frequently.
 *
 * However, if you know that the keys and values within an object should
 * adhere to a particular structure you can more accurately type it using
 * an interface.
 *
 * You can think of an interface as a more specific type of object, where
 * the individual keys and values within the object are defined and typed.
